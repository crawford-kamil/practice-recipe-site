        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese-style curry, also known as "kare" or "kare-raisu," is a popular dish in Japan that has its roots in Indian cuisine. It is a thick and hearty curry dish characterized by its rich and savory flavors. Japanese curry differs from Indian curry in terms of taste and texture.
            Typically, Japanese curry is made by stewing a combination of vegetables, meat (such as beef, chicken, or pork), and aromatic spices in a roux-based sauce. The sauce is made by cooking onions, garlic, and other spices until fragrant, then adding flour and curry powder to create a thickened base. This base is then simmered with vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and onions until they are tender and infused with the curry flavors.
            Japanese curry has a mild and slightly sweet taste compared to its spicier Indian counterparts. It is often served with steamed rice and can be customized with various toppings such as crispy fried cutlets (tonkatsu), soft-boiled eggs, or pickled vegetables. The comforting and satisfying nature of Japanese curry has made it a beloved comfort food in Japan, enjoyed by people of all ages.
